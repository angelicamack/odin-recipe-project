                    <li>
                        Cook/heat up your rice according to package instructions.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Melt cooking oil in pan set to medium heat.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        When oil becomes hot, crack one egg into one side, and one onto the other sie. Careful not to break the yolk if you want it to be runny.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Cook until egg whites look mostly solid, or a little longer if you want the egg crispy on one side. Then, flip!
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Cook only  ashort time on the second side, maybe 15-30 seconds.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Put your egg on the rice! Add salt and pepper to tase and bon appetit. Here you can also add any topping you like - some good ones to try include green onion, soy sauce, spam, kim chi, or avocado.
                    </li>
